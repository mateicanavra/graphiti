    """A Requirement represents a specific need, feature, or functionality that a product or service must fulfill.

    Always ensure an edge is created between the requirement and the project it belongs to, and clearly indicate on the
    edge that the requirement is a requirement.

    Instructions for identifying and extracting requirements:
    1. Look for explicit statements of needs or necessities ("We need X", "X is required", "X must have Y")
    2. Identify functional specifications that describe what the system should do
    3. Pay attention to non-functional requirements like performance, security, or usability criteria
    4. Extract constraints or limitations that must be adhered to
    5. Focus on clear, specific, and measurable requirements rather than vague wishes
    6. Capture the priority or importance if mentioned ("critical", "high priority", etc.)
    7. Include any dependencies between requirements when explicitly stated
    8. Preserve the original intent and scope of the requirement
    9. Categorize requirements appropriately based on their domain or function
