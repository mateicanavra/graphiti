class Procedure(BaseModel):
    """A Procedure informing the agent what actions to take or how to perform in certain scenarios. Procedures are typically composed of several steps.

    Instructions for identifying and extracting procedures:
    1. Look for sequential instructions or steps ("First do X, then do Y")
    2. Identify explicit directives or commands ("Always do X when Y happens")
    3. Pay attention to conditional statements ("If X occurs, then do Y")
    4. Extract procedures that have clear beginning and end points
    5. Focus on actionable instructions rather than general information
    6. Preserve the original sequence and dependencies between steps
    7. Include any specified conditions or triggers for the procedure
    8. Capture any stated purpose or goal of the procedure
    9. Summarize complex procedures while maintaining critical details
